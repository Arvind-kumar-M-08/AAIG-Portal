AAIG portal is a website useful for an university or college management for neat and proper 
organization of information and detials of professors or faculty members and students. 

AAIG is an automated attendance system that consists of a web system for entire 
organization to record attendance, generates ID card for student and faculty members and 
students can register to different courses offered by the faculty. The web application 
is to be used by students, faculty, and admin personnel.



## Features

We have alloted many roles for faculty,admin and students
#### Role of a faculty:
• Each Faculty has his/her own login. On login, the class faculty can see a list of students
or members registered under it.


• The faculty may take the attendance and mark the present students using checkbox
provided in front of every student name. This attendance sheet is stored and sent to the
central administrator of the organization and stored there.


• They can edit their personel details and get generate their ID card

#### Role of an Admin:
• The role of the admin is to add new student and faculty by entering his personal details
and provides the faculty/student with userID and password so that he/she can access
the application.


• Admin can check the attendance of the particular student by entering the roll number
and generate attendance reports.

• The admin may check all attendance data, press a button to see defaulter list, search
for particular student attendance by name, search class attendance and generate excel
reports.

#### Role of a Student:
• The student logs in and checks his/her attendance statistics for different
courses/faculties.

• The student also has the option to register for course available and once he registers for
the course, his name will appear for attendance whenever a faculty logs in to record the
attendance.
